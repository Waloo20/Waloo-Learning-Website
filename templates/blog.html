      <p>
        AI generative tools have become increasingly common over the past year, enabling content generation at a much faster pace. Take this website, for example. On the front page, there are four images, each created using the AI Dall-E with a prompt. I ensured that the prompts were related to what the picture would link to, or that the images were colorized with the website's main theme of black, white, and red. This significantly reduced the time spent on manual image creation, and generating them took only about ten minutes, saving valuable development time.<br><br>

Even the scripting of the website was AI-assisted since I encountered many problems during the development phase. I didn't receive a straight answer from Google or the tutorials I followed. However, I was able to ask Chat-GPT for solutions, and it provided prompt and efficient answers. This not only helped me work through issues faster but also helped me gain a better conceptual understanding of what I was doing.<br><br>

Even this very article, while not completely written by Chat-GPT, was revised by the tool for errors, saving me time and allowing me to focus on more important aspects of the website. This enabled me to complete a viable website in about two days with little starting knowledge. If I wanted to, I could even use it to generate more articles instead of writing them myself and simply describe what I want to write about, much like to a ghostwriter.<br><br>

While some may criticize this approach as being lazy or detrimental, I only see the positives. It allows for the efficient learning of new things without having to go through painstaking trial and error and provides assistance in solving problems. AI is like an eternal intern you don't have to pay, and that's fantastic.
