        <h1 class="text-danger">My Personal Website</h1>
      <p>I have always been intrigued by web development since I was first introduced to the internet as a child. The concept of customizing something and making it accessible to everyone was fascinating. Unfortunately, I never found the motivation to pursue this curiosity, and for a long time, I never learned. As you can tell from reading this text, I eventually did complete a website and learned to develop it. The opportunity arose in one of my college technical writing classes, where one of the assignments was to create a personal website. How convenient!<br><br>

This assignment encouraged students to use website builders like Squarespace or Wix, which would have been entirely suitable and much easier. However, as a Computer Science major, I saw this as a fantastic opportunity to learn new skills and challenge myself. And challenge me it did, as I had to learn a myriad of new concepts that I hadn't known beforehand. Being already familiar with Python, I had heard that the Flask library was useful for web development and simple to use, so I decided to start with that. It enabled me to deploy any HTML I wrote to a development server and use Python logic directly in my HTML file.<br><br>

I created a GitHub repository to store my code and began working. I had to familiarize myself with HTML since I wasn't exactly sure how to use it or its syntax. Fortunately, it wasn't that hard to learn, as the structure of an HTML file (HTML tag, head tag, and body tag) was relatively simple to understand. Furthermore, text uses header or paragraph tags, which are also easy to grasp. So, I was able to write the HTML for the homepage fairly quickly. However, it looked plain and needed to be stylized, which required becoming familiar with CSS. I didn't really want to do that, as creating custom class styles is a tedious task that can slow down development considerably.<br><br>

Thankfully, there are frameworks or preset packages of styles available for those who prioritize speed over perfection. These frameworks enabled me to stylize the entire webpage, making it more presentable, even if not entirely professional. It was especially useful since it came with preset navbar code that I could use without fully understanding how it worked, as it used JavaScript, which I didn't know. After that, all I had to do was create a few more webpages, include basic elements across all of them, and add some decorative elements. The website then became an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and was ready for deployment.<br><br>

I used a website called Render.com to deploy the website code by linking it to the GitHub repository that held the source code. I later discovered that I couldn't use the Flask development server as a production server and had to include a new library called Gunicorn, suitable for full deployment. Once that was done, the website went live, and I felt a sense of pride. I had finally created something on the web that others could visit. Better yet, it was something I could visit as a sort of headquarters to build upon and add new features. Overall, I consider the entire endeavor an enjoyable success.<br><br>
